            <b>Why visit?</b>
            <p>These four attractions are the most well known places to go to in New York City. From the theme park by the beach to the quaint trail in the city, and two of the best palces to learn from while having fun. All these places are relatively cheap to visit and have no age perference making it great for anyone to visit. Luna Park is great for the kids, The Highline is a wonderful trail for a short excursion, and The Guggenheim/Metropolitan Museum are wonderful to quinch your thirst for knowledge.</p>

            <b>How to get in touch?</b>
            <p>Each attraction has its own website that details information about the attration. Information will include; hours of operation, contact information, travel directions, and an about page with several social media links.</p>

            <b>Where to go first?</b>
            <p>Where to go first really depends on the type of person you are. If you like having loads of fun then the first suggestion would be Luna Park with all its rides and attractions. If you like a quaint stroll in a relaxing and aestetically pleasing environment then Highline is your place to go. If both of those don't fit on top of your to do list then you might be a slow starter and want to take your time with either The Metropolitan Museum or the Guggenheim Museum.</p>

            <b>Is their an age perference?</b>
            <p>All four sites have no age perference and is open to the public. Highline is an open trail to walk on just like a park, the Metropolitan/Guggenheim Museum are places of knowledge that will never turn a person away that yerns for knowledge, and Luna Park is a family oriented location and welcomes everyone near and far.</p>

            <b>Is it expensive?</b>
            <p>Relatively all the sites are free with some exceptions of donations like for The Metropolitan and Guggenheim Museums. Highline is open to the public free of charge, and Luna Park doesn't have an entrance fee since it's right next to a beach; but most of its rides, games, and events costs an affordable price.</p>

            <b>When can I go?</b>
            <p>Whenever your heart desires!</p>
