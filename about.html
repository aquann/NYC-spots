                <b>Project Description</b>

                <p>The project will be about New York City tourist destinations to visit. It will have four different locations to choose from which are (Luna Park, Highline, The Guggenheim Museum, and The Metropolitan Museum), as well as an About page. The client would be a travel agency, hotel service, or even a home rental service agency like Airbnb. The client would use this approach to accommodate its customers and guests better with fun activities to do and great places to go.</p>

                <b>Target Audience</b>

                <p>The sort of person to use the site would be ages from 18-60 years of age, the reason for this is because we want to appeal to a wide variety of people and virtually all age groups. The younger people will travel more when school is out and extra money is aside, while an older group from 30 years of age and up could also benefit when going on vacation. Most of the destinations are relatively free like the Highline and the Museums, but Luna Park will have an expected fee of $75 per person for the day. The projected income for the audience would $15,000 to cover for vacation fees, hotel expense from the client's side plus extra money for attractions. The income range is acceptable making it relatively affordable for anyone. The interests we would want from the target audience would be traveling, site seeing, going to the beach, and history enthusiasts.</p>

                <p>Someone would visit the site because they are looking for fun activities to do and great places to go while on vacation. The information they would be looking for is attractions just like Luna Park, or site seeing like what we can offer with Highline. If those activities didnâ€™t suit them for instance because they were an older crowd then The Guggenheim or Metropolitan Museum would be good as well.</p>

                <p>The actions the target audience will take after seeing the site is to go check the About page to gather more information about the attractions. After that they would book a ticket to New York at one of the hotels and go to one of the four attractions or even all of them while on vacation.</p>

                <b>CREATIVE APPROACH</b>

                <p>My creative approach will start off with the text content being in black to have a traditional approach with a cursive serif font to have a sleek approach to give the audience a mentality that this is a professional site. Next the background will have images showing the four locations and a testimonial from a visitor for each of the images under it. The background layout will be in beige but the images will have a faint darker color border around them. The site will have a straight forward css approach of listing the nav bar in the middle for mobile and an inline design for larger screens. The logo will be on the left, then a hero image, after that a title, then both images/texts complimenting each other in either hierarchy or balance, a map to show where everything is located, and lastly a footer showing copyrights of the creator.</p>
